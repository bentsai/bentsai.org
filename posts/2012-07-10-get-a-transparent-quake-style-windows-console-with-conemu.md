After reading [Hanselman's post about ConEmu](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/ConEmuTheWindowsTerminalConsolePromptWeveBeenWaitingFor.aspx), I installed it and tried briefly to customize the UI a bit. The menus and options are ultra-confusing, so I only got so far. Thankfully, [Josh Earl](http://whiletruecode.com/) did what I was hoping someone would do: he made a sweet looking configuration and posted the details.

Now I've got a Quake-style Windows console at my fingertips. And yes, **Quake style slide down** is actually an option in [ConEmu's latest builds](https://code.google.com/p/conemu-maximus5/downloads/list), so it's safe to say it will remain pinned to my taskbar.
