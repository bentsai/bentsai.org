I've read a lot about "agile" development for many years and longed to try it out. Through all of my research, it was easy to get caught up in a particular implementation (Scrum, XP) or a set of tools (Post-It notes, rally, spreadsheets, information radiators). At times, I think, if we just got everyone on board with this tool, people would see the benefits and we would be on our way to becoming more agile. But that's actually backwards and futile.

> Great teams do not "do" Agile, great teams "are" Agile.

Once again, it comes back to the people. And shouldn't that be obvious, because the first tenet of Agile is _individuals and interactions **over** processes and tools_. Even reading and writing that now, that's a big "duh" to me.

> Here's a quick test to see if you are a member of an agile team. Does the team trust each other and communicate frequently and honestly? Give yourself a point. You're moving faster towards clear, shared goals with less hesitation and fewer missteps. Individuals and interactions - sound familiar? The Speed of Trust can be measured, don't waste your client's money on avoidable drag.

I'm discovering this more and more each day. If you have teammates that embrace the principles of the Agile Manifesto, this will work.
