I have no idea why, but my [`bible`](https://github.com/covode/bible-fetch/) script broke. It complained that `bs4` is not installed. This was working a few weeks ago. Anyway, it seems it is notoriously difficult to get Python set up correctly on macOS. So, I tried these steps, and it is now working again: [The right and wrong way to set Python 3 as default on a Mac](https://opensource.com/article/19/5/python-3-default-mac#what-to-do).
