title: I moved my blog
date: 2020-06-11
layout: layouts/post.njk

I moved my old posts from https://bentsai.wordpress.com to here. I exported my
posts into some Wordpress XML format, and then used
[wordpress-export-to-markdown](https://github.com/lonekorean/wordpress-export-to-markdown).
It went smoothly â€“ I just had to add another metadata field for `layout` to use
the right 11ty template.

I have some clean up to do. Some images are broken, others are links instead of
inline. And "link" posts are missing links.
