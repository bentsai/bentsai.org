I started a quest six months ago to bring a human-centered approach to how we
build product at work. I realized that no one on my team had seen a customer
user our product, let alone any feature we had implemented. So **"connecting
engineers with customers"** became my mantra. I looked for opportunities and
also asked the leaders in my organization.

But there was a disconnect.

_We do have many opportunities for engineers to interact with customers_, I
heard. _We have a beta program. Sometimes we get pulled into support
escalations. Those are all times we can and should engage the customer._

That's when I realized I failed to be precise around what "connecting with
customers" meant, and how frequently the discovery and design phase of
development is foreign to Engineering. Our Scrum process does not adequately
support this kind of behavior.

A conversation with a seasoned engineering leader crystallized this for me. We
were talking about how we build empathy for the customer. He said that he had
done this developing relationships with customers through years of working with
them, presumably through escalations and other activities where he was
validating our solutions with them.

My response: Rather than having the goal of understanding customer goals and
needs as a side effect, let's be intentional about it! **Engineering should
partner and participate in user research.** This would be a more effective and
efficient way of building empathy and making sure we are solving the right
problems.
