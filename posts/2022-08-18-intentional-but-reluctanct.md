I know [Jeetu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeetupatel) is speaking from his
personal perspective, and what can feel like a different world—a world inhabited
by VCs, executives, administrative assistants and contained in airplane lounges,
board rooms, and corner offices. At the same time, if there was ever a case when
I was in the same context as an executive of a Fortune 100 company, it's this
one!

Perhaps the first step on the path to less meetings begins with the leader being
intentional about not being in so many meetings. But if that "superpower" is to
be at all bestowed on the broader organization, there must be a subsequent
intentionality to foster a culture where people's careers are not so dependent
on being in meetings.

My idea to shift this power dynamic is through making information more
accessible. While understanding and embracing a company's vision is critical,
equally important is having the information and data to make the right
decisions. So often, that context is provided in meetings, as are decisions.

I've been enamored with company cultures that value writing. Some that I have
read and studied:

- [Amazon's 6 pagers](https://thehustle.co/02162021-amazon-writing/)
- [Stripe](https://productify.substack.com/p/case-study-5-stripes-greatest-superpower)
- [HashiCorp](https://works.hashicorp.com/articles/writing-practices-and-culture)
- [GitLab's Handbooks](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/handbook-usage/#why-handbook-first)

Each of these companies approach it in a different way, but the one commonality
is the motivation to **empower individuals and teams to do their best work.**

How does this culture change happen? I think it must be primarily top-down
because that's the direction the information and context needs to flow. Until
that happens, I will continue to attend meetings with intention and reluctance.
