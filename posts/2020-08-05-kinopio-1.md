I am currently enamored with [Kinopio](https://kinopio.club). The creator
describes it so:

> Kinopio is the visual thinking tool for new ideas and hard problems.

After using it for a month, this rings true to me. The premise is simple. You
have cards, which can have text and/or an image. You can put these cards
anywhere on your canvas. And then you can connect cards. That's _pretty much
it_. But that's the genius behind it.

It is brilliantly executed. The interactions are fast and fun. The cards jiggle
when you drag them. The connections obey some laws of physics. This app oozes
personality. It's like a fidget toy for your brain. It **feels** perfect.

Check out what I've used it for so far:
