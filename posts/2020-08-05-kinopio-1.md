![Kinopio blog post](../../img/Screenshot_2020-08-05-Kinopio.png)

I am currently enamored with [Kinopio](https://kinopio.club). The creator
describes it so:

> Kinopio is the visual thinking tool for new ideas and hard problems.

After using it for a month, this rings true to me. The premise is simple. You
have cards, which can have text and/or an image. You can put these cards
anywhere on your canvas. And then you can connect cards. That's _pretty much
it_. But that's the genius behind it.

It is brilliantly executed. The interactions are fast and fun. The cards jiggle
when you drag them. The connections obey some laws of physics. This app oozes
personality. It's like a fidget toy for your brain. It **feels** perfect.

Check out what I've used it for so far:

- [Presentation on pair programming](https://kinopio.club/-programming-frZwGmep_m9vHR52U7wwO)
- Team retrospective (collaborative)
- [Notes for an academic paper](https://kinopio.club/1-c2-paper-CPG9szKXfU8zFWxPyqhIj)
- Work journal
- Documenting

## Why it's awesome

I've tried and continue to try tools to capture and organize personal and work
information. It's been a career-long quest. I've gravitated towards plaintext
solutions, inevitable involving Markdown syntax. But I'm not opposed to systems
that are database-backed like Trello, Bear or Notion. I'm not saying I've found
the holy grail of my quest, but here's the key for me of why Kinopio is great:
**It frees me from thinking about organization**.

![Brain dump]()

Whenever you take notes, regardless of the app, I am inherently organizing it.
Perhaps it is too obvious to state, but text is a linear format. I write some
words in a document. Then I wrote more words. I can put those words before or
after the existing words. I might try to capture some hierarchy with some
Markdown headings or group like ideas by adding blank lines. But the nature of
the format is there is some friction with moving these thoughts and ideas
around. And it is difficult to express relationships outside of a strict
outline-based hierarchy. An idea can only practically be under a single heading.

Kinopio really shines for taking notes in a lecture or a team meeting. The
genius of Kinopio is how effortless it makes moving my thoughts around and
drawing connections. Indeed, when writing down a thought, I do have to decide
where to position it on the canvas. But since the friction is so low to move a
card, I am not committed to whatever organization I currently have in mind. It
can evolve, and when it does, the tool lets me do that.

On top of that, I can easily make connections between thoughts, even if they are
not close in proximity. Let's say the speaker revisits a concept she introduced
earlier in the talk. It feels so natural to connect those two ideas on the
canvas.

Kinopio worked incredibly for a team discussion where I could quickly capture
the various opinions my teammates were sharing (often on varying topics), and
then iteratively organize and connect concepts together. It was like having a
staging area for my brain.

## Real-time collaboration

You can use Kinopio in real-time with others. I used this for our retrospective.
Our current tool is Trello. It works well and the structure of lists is
compatible with how we run our retros. But the spatial and visual aspect of
Kinopio made the experience really fun. Erik shared this:

> i felt like i was part of a gigantic hive mind. i felt part of the
> manipulation, but the manipulation happened in such an accelerated coordinated
> way

### Contrast with Miro

Miro has so many bells and whistles, it is exhausting and cumbersome. It tries
to mimic the real world too much. I don't want to fiddle with the size, color,
shape of my stickies. In a virtual summit, the facilitators were literally
creating stacks of virtual stickies. Huh?

Yes, Miro is a different kind of tool for the enterprise market, maybe more for
designers. But it provides an interesting contrast in areas that they overlap.

One feature that would open up more possibilities for Kinopio to be used for
collaboration sessions would be a way to denote specific areas on the canvas.
Like, reserve this area of the canvas for these ideas. So all you have to do is
move cards there, rather than connect them.

## Philosophy

- Straightforward business model
- Design to run local first
- Can export all data
- API available
- Can delete all data

## Call to action

I've got a lot more to say about this. But for now, go
