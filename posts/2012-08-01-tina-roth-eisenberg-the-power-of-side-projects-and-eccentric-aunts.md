Tina Roth Eisenberg, founder of [swiss miss](http://www.swiss-miss.com/), spoke
recently at [TYPO San Francisco 2012](http://typotalks.com/sanfrancisco/) about
the power of side projects. Her recent venture, [Tattly](http://tattly.com/),
started as a side project and hit it big. She also created
[TeuxDeux](http://teuxdeux.com/).

Another story that came across my feed today was about how
[Flowdock](https://flowdock.com/) also started as a side project and has
apparently turned a little software consultancy into a product company. From an
interview with the founder, [Otto Hilska](http://twitter.com/mutru), three
take-ways:

> - **Start small:** Flowdock started as a side project. Sometimes, if you have
>   serious resources, you can afford to dive wholesale into an idea, but for
>   most people it’s way smarter to experiment and build within your means.
> - **Fix your own problem:** Flowdock was their own customer. They typified the
>   type of client they were trying to attract. This vastly simplifies the
>   feedback loop required to create a good product.
> - **Play Nice with Others:** Flowdock’s biggest source of customers is their
>   integration partners. If you build your product so it syncs/has an
>   API/connects with other apps your customer uses, you are building marketing
>   channels directly into your product.
