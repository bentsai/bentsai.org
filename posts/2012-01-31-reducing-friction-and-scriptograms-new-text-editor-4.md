I'm really loving how [Scriptogram](http://scriptogr.am) has been pumping out
useful, high-quality features. I'm typing this post in the new text editor,
which lets you compose a post directly from the browser. When I first saw that
this was on the upcoming feature list, my impression was that this shouldn't be
a high priority. One major advantage of having posts be synced from Dropbox
files is that you can use whatever text editor you want locally.

But what this feature does is **reduce the friction** of writing posts even
more, and that is a powerful idea. Even though the text editor is fairly bare
bones (no support for links, no HTML preview, no auto-save), it eliminates the
overhead of navigating the file system, creating and naming a new text file, and
typing in the proper header. [John D. Cook](http://www.johndcook.com/) wrote a
post explaining this concept that
[a little simplicity goes a long way](http://www.johndcook.com/blog/2008/04/09/a-little-simplicity-goes-a-long-way/):

This is a huge reason why I'm so enamored by these
[blogging services that use Dropbox](http://scriptogr.am/bentsai/post/markdown-blogging-dropbox-oh-my).
There are plenty of blogging tools and services out there that make it easy to
blog: Posterous, wordpress, tumblr, etc. Indeed, they've done a remarkable job
of lowering the barrier of entry. But why do I like Scriptogram the most? It's a
_little bit_ easier and simpler. There may actually be the same number of steps,
but another component is the _cognitive_ overload that it reduces. With
Scriptogram, I'm simply editing a text file on my computer using Markdown. I'm
limited by Markdown's formatting abilities, which is a good thing. That _little
bit_ has been the deal-breaker and the reason for more posts as of late.

This also partly touches on why "simple" apps are all the rage and the notion
that "less is more." From
[37 Signals' _Less Software_ chapter from **Getting Real**](http://gettingreal.37signals.com/ch10_Less_Software.php):

- Less software is easier to manage.
- Less software reduces your codebase and that means less maintenance busywork
  (and a happier staff).
- Less software lowers your cost of change so you can adapt quickly. You can
  change your mind without having to change boatloads of code.
- Less software results in fewer bugs.
- Less software means less support.

Software is incredibly complex. I want to have the minimum possible. It's always
a victory to me when I can get rid of code.
