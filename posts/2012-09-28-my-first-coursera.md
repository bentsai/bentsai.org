I've started an [online course on HCI](https://www.coursera.org/course/hci)
offered through Coursera. It's led by Scott Klemmer of Standford University. My
initial experience of the site and the course has been good. You can speed up
the playback rate of the lectures, which is a big plus. The total lecture time
for this week was about 40 minutes, which is certainly manageable. Subtitles are
provided, as well as a transcription of the lecture. There are quick quizzes in
the middle of the lecture which help keep you honest in terms of paying
attention.

I just finished watching the first week's lectures, which provided an
introduction to the topic of HCI: a history of the field, prototyping, and
evaluating designs.

# The Power of Prototyping

They're meant to be incomplete. You can think of them as a question, in physical
form. As such, you will build different kinds of prototypes to ask (and answer)
different kinds of questions:

- _What might this work like?_
- _What might this feel like?_
- _What is the experience of using this?_

It's a vehicle for communication.

One example he offered was a prototype for the original Palm Pilot. The designer
created a prototype that was simply a pocket-sized block of wood. When the
situation arose, he would pull the board out of his pocket and pretend to input
information into it. This process helped them answer the question, _What size
should it be?_

# Evaluating Designs

The lecturer gave a whirlwind tour of a handful of techniques you can use to
evaluate a design: usability studies, surveys, observation, to name a few. This
is something I hope to learn from this course. Without any formal training, the
only basis I have when evaluating designs is my intuition. While I'm sure this
has some value, I know there are established metrics and principles which can be
applied to better quantify the effectiveness of a design.

# First Assignment

In this course, we actually have assignments. I'm glad they've provided the
opportunity to implement something real that will be evaluated and graded. I'm
just not sure if I'll have the motivation to do them. This first one focuses on
**Needfinding** (a new term to me). It involves choosing a _design brief_, which
is something like a theme or problem you want to solve, and then physically
going out to gather data by observing and interviewing three people outside of
your field.

The design briefs all sound very interesting. They are areas that I generally
think about. The first is **Change**, and it has to do with using technology to
help people make changes in their life. Things like FitBit, BodyMedia,
quantified-self, Lift, Nike+ come to mind. The second brief is **Glance**, which
addresses information overload. How do we display information that is relevant
to the user? (Think Prismatic, dashboards, widgets). The last area is **Time**.
Design something that changes the way people interact with time. Two examples
from the course itself are [Qlocktwo](http://qlocktwo.com/) and
[Sleep Cycle](http://www.sleepcycle.com).

The assignment part is where it gets trickierâ€”who am I going to survey? Off the
top of my head, I'm thinking of the barista at Commonplace, the butcher at
WholeFoods, and a pizza-maker. I'll have to think more about this, and look at
what would actually work.
