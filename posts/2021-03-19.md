**01**[ My post about increasing the card width in Kinopio](https://club.kinopio.club/t/suggestions-image-gif-resizing-font-italics-bold-underline/164/32?u=bentsai)
got me thinking about doing it locally with JavaScript.

This reminded me of an old project called dotjs by @defunkt. I looked it up, and
it's no longer maintained, but it had a pointer to a successor:
https://luciopaiva.com/witchcraft/

But wait, how is this different from user script extensions like Greasemonkey?
And that seems straightforward because the former requires running a separate
web server to serve the JS.

Now I'm using the
[Violentmonkey extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/violentmonkey/jinjaccalgkegednnccohejagnlnfdag)
to run a script that adjusts the `max-width`s of cards to 320px. It needs some
tweaks because it only runs when you first visit the space.

**02** I'm trying to use Safari as my default browser, but a lot of extensions I
want to try are Chrome-only. Kinda sad. So now wondering what Chrome-based
browser should I use? I've been using Edge, but maybe I want to go with one
that's not backed by a giant company.

I used to use Brave, for some reason I stopped, but maybe it's time to try
again. I used Vivaldi for a while, but it ended up being buggy in some places.
This is my low-key highly-ineffective way of sticking it to the man.

**03** some kind of generative art thing https://makepad.dev/

**04** I wrote
[a script that pulls all my Kinopio data and puts it into a SQLite database](https://github.com/bentsai/kinopio-to-sqlite)
so I can explore using [Datasette](https://datasette.io). This is really cool
and deserves a separate post.
