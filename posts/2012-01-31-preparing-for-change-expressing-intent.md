John D. Cook, making a helpful observation about justifying code refactoring:

> **If you focus on making your intentions clear, your code will be easier to
> maintain.** If you focus on maintainability alone, it might backfire. You
> might get lots of unneeded code, inserted with the intent of making future
> maintenance easier, that makes maintenance harder.
