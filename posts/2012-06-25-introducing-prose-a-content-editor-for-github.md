Yet another project that involves reducing the friction of writing Markdown in a blog. This one is GitHub-centric. You authorize it with GitHub, and it manages your Jekyll site. From the [Getting Started](http://prose.io/help/getting-started.html) page:

> Prose is similiar to iAWriter as it is also using a minimal interface for editing Markdown, but it’s web-based and uses Github for storing your text so your writings are more than save and Github keeps a history of every saved version. So Prose can potentially be seen as a whole new way of sharing documents online, while utilizing the usual suspects Markdown and Github. Oh and it’s free and open source.

It looks pretty, too.
