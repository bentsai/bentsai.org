Blue Apron has been a game-changer in my household. It lowered the bar for me to
learn how to cook by cutting out shopping and finding recipes, and limiting the
cook time. The lower bar enabled me to focus on just the prep work and cooking,
so now I'm cooking! The feedback loop here is obvious—cook food, eat food, yum,
repeat.

This is a general principle that applies everywhere. Remove friction and tighten
feedback loops. Then iterate and expand. For example, at my job. If we want to
have better quality through more testing, we start small. Set up a testing
framework and create examples that enable the team to easily get started. They
can copy the existing examples and modify for their features. Create a feedback
loop that automates the testing and makes the results visible. Once you
establish that, you can start adding more sophisticated tests and increase
coverage.
