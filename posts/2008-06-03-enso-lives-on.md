Days after [I lamented about Enso's death](http://bentsai.wordpress.com/2008/05/28/enso-dead-back-to-launchy/), Atul posted a [progress report](http://www.toolness.com/wp/?p=44), providing an overview of what's been going on since open-sourcing Enso. I did suspect (and hope) that Enso was was, in fact, [not dead](http://www.evilbrainjono.net/cgi-bin/blog/showblog.cgi?permalink=503) - I poked around the [code repostitory](http://code.google.com/p/enso/) and browsed the [developer's forums](http://groups.google.com/group/enso-developers) and saw some healthy activity. I was glad to finally hear some direction for where the project is going. Enso is very much alive:)

While looking through the discussions, I came across a [nifty Enso interface demo](http://www.schuderer.net/experiments.shtml#ensoid) by Andreas Schuderer implemented in JavaScript. It's a great example of "Show, Don't Tell".
