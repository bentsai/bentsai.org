I'm doing some brief research about how to run our second retrospective. Here's
Jean Tabaka of [Rally Software](http://www.rallydev.com) giving a short talk
about running them:

Quick notes:

- Retrospectives are about the team and not so much about the project.
- Processes:
  - Plusses and deltas: What things went well? (+) What are things that didn't
    go well? (delta)
  - Wind and anchors. Similar, viewing the iteration as a journey.
  - ORID: Objective, reflective, interpretive, decisional.
  - 3 H's: Helped, hindered, hypothesis.
- Consider making an implementation backlog
- Appreciations and apologies: a time of reflection at the end.
