[Uncle Bob](http://www.8thlight.com/our-team/robert-martin) explains why
software estimation is so hard:

> It turns out that we don’t know the procedure. We haven’t got any clue to just
> how difficult the procedure is. We aren’t computers. We don’t follow
> procedures. And so comparing the complexity of the manual task, to the
> complexity of the procedure is invalid.
>
> This is one of the reasons that estimates are so hard, and why we get them
> wrong so often. We look at a task that seems easy and estimate it on that
> basis, only to find that writing down the procedure is actually quite
> intricate. We blow the estimate because we estimate the wrong thing.

This is really insightful. It helps to recognize _why_ my estimates are so off,
instead of applying some rule-of-thumb padding.
