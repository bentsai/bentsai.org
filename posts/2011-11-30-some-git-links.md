I'm trying to do a lot of things at the same time: learn git, learn git-svn, and get git setup with Windows. That last item is probably least important; here are some links I'll eventually dig into:

- [Git on Windows](http://www.jeremyskinner.co.uk/git-on-windows/)
- [Git & PowerShell Revisited](http://markembling.info/2010/03/git-powershell-revisited)
- [posh-git](https://github.com/dahlbyk/posh-git)
- [Pro Git](http://progit.org/)
- [Setting Up Git in Windows with Diffmerge, Powershell, Posh-Git, and Console2](http://jdonley83.com/setting-up-git-in-windows-with-diffmerge-powershell-posh-git-and-console2)
