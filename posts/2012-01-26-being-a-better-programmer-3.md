I saw this in my twitter feed:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>Highly polished and impressive videos on the Essentials of Programming: <a href="http://t.co/vLqAO7R4" title="http://hillelcoren.com/coder">hillelcoren.com/coder</a></p>â€” Scott Hanselman (@shanselman) <a href="https://twitter.com/shanselman/status/160447302899732480">January 20, 2012</a></blockquote>

I watched through the whole thing, and it is indeed an impressive collection of
tips to becoming a better programmer. The videos cover a breadth of topics in a
short period of time. To give you a taste, the first unit covers managing
complexity, the single responsibility principle, separation of concerns, TDD and
design patterns. And that's only the first 2 minutes. The total running time is
20 minutes, so you should watch them:

The videos have a strange feel to them, since they use public domain clips
overlaid with After Effects-generated titles and effects. The visuals are not
crucial and more often than not, result in curious juxtapositions of software
wisdom with campy footage. Regardless, the content is great.
