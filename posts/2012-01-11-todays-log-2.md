Visited links

Restricting NumericUpDown control input How do I make a textbox that only
accepts numbers? Rebase help on Github Git Cheatsheet git ready: a blog of git
tips At A Distance: a game.

Miscellanea

I should write an extension that copies link text and pastes a
Markdown-formatted link. That would make link blogging easier. Basically, it
would take a link, and output:

\[%link_text%\](%href%)

This probably exists, but I haven't found it yet.
