I love trying out new tools. It usually comes at the expense of being
productive, but I _feel_ productive and it's fun. These are tools I've found
over the years that I use regularly, meaning they have indeed helped me to
productive.

- [GitUp](https://gitup.co) - For basic, everyday `git`, I use GitUp because it
  is **fast** (by interfacing directly with the repository database) and
  **simple**.
- [Alfred](https://alfredapp.com) - It's my launcher _and_ my clipboard/snippet
  manager. It has a lot more features I don't use.
- [Rocket](https://matthewpalmer.net/rocket/index.html) - This gives me emoji at
  my fingertips globally. I've mapped my trigger shortcut to `â€¦`. I can't live
  without it now.
- [Spectacle](https://www.spectacleapp.com) - It's a window manager. The two
  main shortcuts I use are 1) moving a window to the next display and 2) docking
  a window to the right/left half of the display.
- [Easy Move+Resize](https://github.com/dmarcotte/easy-move-resize) - Somehow in
  my very limited use of X on Unix machines in my college days, I picked up this
  muscle memory of moving and resizing windows with a keyboard modifier and
  mouse drag. This lets me replicate that.
