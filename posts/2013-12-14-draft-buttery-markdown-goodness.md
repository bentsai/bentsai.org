I had signed up for [Draft](http://draftin.com) a while ago when it first came
out, but quickly forgot about it. There are just an overwhelming number of web
apps that spin a distraction-free, Markdown editor one way or another. Yet, a
recent blog post from [@philgr](https://twitter.com/philgr) about
[using Pythonista to pull down the latest document to his iPhone](http://philgr.com/blog/open-your-last-draftin-article-in-your-ios-text-editor)
got me logged back into it, and I must say, I'm impressed!

Draft has a myriad of export options, including Wordpress[1](#fn1) and Dropbox.
The latter is key, since it makes my documents available basically everywhere. I
was delightfully surprised to see that Draft actually syncs with Dropbox. There
are really interesting features geared towards collaboration, which are neat
(comments, versioning). And it appears
[the author](https://twitter.com/natekontny) is consistently updating the app,
and charging for premium features, which is great to see.

It's free to use, so check it out.
