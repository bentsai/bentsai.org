[John D. Cook](http://www.johndcook.com/) makes a very astute point about the
nature of software:

> Not only is DNA not source code, in a sense even source code is not source

> used to build a program, is not source code in the colloquial sense of
> “everything you need to know.”

And also:

> There’s always extra knowledge needed outside the code. This extra knowledge

The fact that there is "extra knowledge" that is not communicated through the
source code is big deal and important to recognize. How do we capture the tribal
knowledge that accumulates as a project progresses? How do we open the walled
gardens of communications among the team? How do we keep track of the gotchas,
tips and tricks and minutiae of working on, building, and deploying the
software?

Most of the tools and processes software developers use daily attempt to address
and alleviate this issue. Version control stores the history of code changes and
provides the ability to annotate those changes. Bug tracking keeps track of
defects and communicates what the problems and fixes are. We have daily
standups, kanban boards, chats, emails, wikis, post-it notes - a huge range of
forms of capturing and sharing information.
