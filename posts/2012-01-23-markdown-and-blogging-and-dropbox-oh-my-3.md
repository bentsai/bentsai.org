There are a bunch of new blogging services that have surfaced recently that share quite a few similarities:

- Use Markdown for the post medium
- Use Dropbox for syncing and delivery
- Boast simplicity and ease-of publishing
- Emphasize clean design

I first heard of [Calepin](http://calepin.co) a few months ago. I liked the experience of creating posts locally using Markdown, hitting the "Publish" button, and seeing it live with minimal hassle. I even looked into [migrating my wordpress blog](http://scriptogr.am/bentsai/post/from-wordpress-to-markdown) to use Calepin exclusively. There was one minor niggle[1](1) I had with the service: there is no way to view all (or recent) posts on one page, nor previous/next links on posts. And no plans for that. I've always preferred to view a blog's content on a single page and found it annoying to manually step articles post by post.

Then, in the past week or so, two new services cropped up: [Skrivr](http://skrivr.com) and [Scriptogram](http://scriptogr.am). The former seems to differentiate itself with emmaculate typography and attractive themes. The latter is eerily similar in many ways to Calepin, but plans to support themes. Two things I liked about the newer services is that they _do_ display all your posts on one page.

## Calepin

- First kid on the block
- Developer has a specific vision and good design sensibilities
- Premium plan in the works

I appreciate that Calepin's developer is highly-opinionated and sticks to his guns. He's decided not to allow custom themes or CSS, and each post gets its own page. It's clear he has a vision for his service and a plan to sustain it.

## Skrivr

- Beautiful themes out-of-the-box
- Quirky method for specifying posts
- Invite-only
- Customizable

Skrivr sports good-looking themes and a responsive layout out of the box. Creating a post feels kludgy; you're forced to give every post a category, and metadata is pulled from the filename. The service is currently invite-only, though the owners quickly sent me an invite when I asked. The themes are also very [customizable](http://skrivr.com/blog/static/3-create-a-custom-theme), but to a fault. I don't want to mess with templates.

## Scriptogram

Just like Calepin, but:

- Custom CSS
- All posts on single page
- Free

When Scriptogram first came out, I ignored it because it seemed like such a rip off of Calepin. The publish page had the same three-column layout and workflow, so I assumed it was some disingenuous script kiddie. But it's become apparent that this is not copycat[2](2). In the past week, the developer has rolled out custom domain support and a nice CSS editor. It's [a bit worrisome that he plans to keep the service free](http://blog.pinboard.in/2011/12/don_t_be_a_free_user/). But for now, I like it the best. It's easy to use and just flexible enough for my needs.
