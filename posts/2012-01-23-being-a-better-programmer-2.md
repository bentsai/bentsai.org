I watched through the whole thing, and it is indeed an impressive collection of
tips to becoming a better programmer. The videos cover a breadth of topics in a
short period of time. To give you a taste, the first unit covers managing
complexity, the single responsibility principle, separation of concerns, TDD and
design patterns. And that's only 2 minutes. It's only about 20 minutes total, so
you should watch them:

The videos have a strange feel to them, since they use public domain clips
overlaid with After Effects-generated titles and effects. The visuals are not
crucial and more often than not, result in curious juxtapositions of software
wisdom with campy footage. Regardless, the content is great.
