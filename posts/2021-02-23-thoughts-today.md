**#0** **_Kinopio → Datasette_** I have this idea to pull my data out of Kinopio and
import it into Datasette. It seems very much in line with what the Datasette is
designed for—make it easy to browse data. I took up
[Simon Willison](https://twitter.com/simonw)'s office hours offer a few weeks
ago, and he seemed keen on the idea.

**#1** I found
[Oliver Andrich's blog](https://andrich.me/weeknote-new-beginnings-2) via
[Simon Willison](https://twitter.com/simonw). I like how he uses the pound
number to begin each paragraph. I've stolen it.

**#2** I ranted a few days ago about how `git` is inscrutable and I'm sad `hg`
lost. A better interface for Git: https://github.com/chriswalz/bit

**#3** **I got my first Mac recently.** I only started using macOS full time when I
started at Cisco 5 years ago. Despite being a relative newcomer to the platform,
I've somehow developed some habits/opinions about using my machine. Here are a
few things I found myself configuring before my computer felt _usable_:

- Turned the resolution up to maxp)
- Turned on tap-to-click for the trackpad
- Turned on three-finger drag. This option is tucked away under Accessibility
  options for some reason.
- Map capslock to esc. Eventually, I'll most like set up capslock to be a
  hyperkey.
