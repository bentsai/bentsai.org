**#0** _Kinopio â†’ Datasette_ I have this idea to pull my data out of Kinopio and
import it into Datasette. It seems very much in line with what the Datasette is
designed forâ€”make it easy to browse data. I took up
[Simon Willison](https://twitter.com/simonw)'s office hours offer a few weeks
ago, and he seemed keen on the idea.

**#1** I found
[Oliver Andrich's blog](https://andrich.me/weeknote-new-beginnings-2) via
[Simon Willison](https://twitter.com/simonw). I like how he uses the pound
number to begin each paragraph. I've stolen it.

**#2** I ranted a few days ago about how git is inscrutable and I'm sad hg lost.
