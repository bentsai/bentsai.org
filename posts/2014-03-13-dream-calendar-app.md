Here's a doodle of some ideas I've had in my head, based on my rant of current
calendar apps. I'm exploring the use of clocks to show my busyness landscape.
Although it gets a little awkward at the AM-to-PM transition, clocks are
ubiquitous and easily interpreted. I'm using clocks also to show duration,
which, by stacking, I can save space. So, each line on the grid represents up to
two hours. Events with zero duration and all-day events should be treated
differently.
