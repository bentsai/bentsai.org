I recently
[answered a question](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/8620/flaky-iphone-4-home-button/34535#34535)
on [apple.stackexchange.com](http://apple.stackexchange.com):

...I wanted to offer up some useful information that I learned from the Apple
Store. The home button on my wife's iPhone 4 was acting flaky, so we brought it
in to a technician. After asking whether we've tried a soft, hard and factory
reset, he notified us that, barring those solutions, they could replace the
phone for \$149 (not free since it is out of warranty). But then, he also
offered a workaround that I was not aware of: AssistiveTouch.

Basically, this iOS 5 feature allows you to access some system-level functions
from an onscreen menu. In particular, **this gives you a software home button,
and it's baked into the OS!** It even responds to double and triple taps. If
your home button is flaky or broken, this is a robust workaround. This also
comes in handy if any of your other hardware components are broken. You can
mute/unmute, do a "shake", adjust volume, and rotate/lock screen from this menu.

To access it, go to `Settings->General->Accessibility`:

Scroll down to the _Physical & Motor_ and tap `AssistiveTouch`:

You will get an overlayed touch target, which opens a menu where you can operate
the home button, among other things:

Using the Assistive Touch feature, you can also save custom gestures and
initiate multi-touching using only one finger, although I haven't found any use
for this yet. There isn't much documentation on this feature; it's one of those
[hidden gems](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/27761/what-tiny-thing-in-ios-5-makes-you-smile-or-has-caught-you-off-guard)
that will prove especially useful with aging hardware.
