As a follow up to
[yesterday's post](http://bentsai.wordpress.com/2014/02/26/day-one-templates-using-launch-center-pro/),
here is my [Launch Center Pro action](http://launchcenterpro.com/k2cdnk) for
tracking where/what I ate every day. It's the same concept, with the addition of
setting a schedule on that action so that I get a notification every night at
9:30pm that reminds me to fill out the survey.
