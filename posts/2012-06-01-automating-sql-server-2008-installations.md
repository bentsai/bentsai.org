While waiting for SQL Server 2008 to install after walking through a Confluence page full of screenshots of the setup wizard and thinking to myself, "there has got to be a better way," I did a simply DuckDuckGo search for "automating SQL Server installation" and came across this post. Presumably, the wizard basically produces a INI file which you can hand to the setup.exe. This is awesomer. Thank you, Sidharth.
