It's starting to feel a lot like summer. During a recent visit
to [Arriviste](http://arriviste.coffee/), I tried one of their seasonal
specials, which consisted of espresso, Coke, and bitters (the name escapes me).
It was delicious and it inspired me to make my own. So, I dusted off my Toddy
and made a batch
of [Musumba from Commonplace](https://thecommonplacecoffeehouse.com/product/musumba-burundi/) with
the standard Toddy recipe. Then:

- 4 ounces of cold brew
- 4 ounces of tonic water
- 1 tsp of simple syrup
- Dash of aromatic bitters

Enjoy!
