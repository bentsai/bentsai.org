I've been in a productivity funk (a.k.a. easily distracted), so I figured it's
time to pull out an old hack that I've had mild success with: the üçÖ Pomodoro
Technique[1]. This path often got sidetracked by finding the perfect Pomodoro
app. But now, I've got a dedicated **physical** timer with audible ticking which
I'm super excited about:

I've said it before, others have said it, and I'll say it again ‚Äì there's
something about having tools that do a single thing. The app versions were
especially distracting because they ended up being an additional digital
distraction. So, let's give this a go!

[1]: My version of this is: Set the timer for 25 minutes and commit to not check
twitter, etc during that time. Then take a 5 minute break. Write down what you
did. Repeat. We'll see if I go more formal.
