I am currently enamored with [Kinopio](https://kinopio.club). It is a tool where you create cards on a canvas that you can then organize by moving and connecting. It is sorta like Trello, but more spatial and fluid, less structured. And whimsical and playful.

What I've used it for:

- Sentence diagramming
- Presentation on pair programming
- Team retrospective (collaborative)
- Notes for an academic paper
- Work journal

Great for thinking. Visual and spatial. Two modes: first is brain dump. Then, reflection and refining. Moving around cards, making connections.
